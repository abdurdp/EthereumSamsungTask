# Android App Development For Foldable Phones:
We all know that the smartphone has been providing new experiences for the last 10 years. And it actually changed the way people think, act, and also, communicate. Additionally, It also opened up a lot of new opportunities for the developers. Now we believe a foldable phone is one of the game-changers, which will provide a very unique experience to the users and also new opportunities for the developers to drive innovations.
The first Samsung foldable phone is designed to be a multi-display with two screens, and also support multi-window for better experienced user experience. So let's take our first to look at what the actual configuration of the display on the device looks like. So this is the main display when the device is unfolded. The main display is large enough to provide a very unique experience. With just more surface, the experience becomes richer and more immersive. The experience was hardly achievable,
even from the existing larger screen smartphones. In addition to the richer and immersive experience from a single large screen, true multitasking will become also available to utilize this larger screen with up to three multi-active windows. The app experience continues between the folded mode and also unfolded mode. Multi-active windows for multitasking is also one of the key features of the Affordable iPhone. While watching a YouTube video, if you want to browse a website, you can just open a browser and browse the website while your video keeps playing. Moreover, if your friend actually sends a message, and the message notification pops up, what you can do is just to grab the message and drag it to a third window like this to continue chatting and browsing while your video keeps playing. So we have discussed the expected experience with the new affordable device.

# Make your APP Foldable Friendly:
Know more about how you can take advantage of foldables in your apps and kind of the guidelines that we would commence to do so. So first up is screen continuity. Screen continuity is what we call the concept of continuing what you're currently doing after you fold or unfold the device. For example, you have a map you're looking at on a folded device, and you would like to see maybe a bit more about the surroundings of the place you're looking at. So as a user, you unfold the phone. And with a continuous experience, you are still looking at the same place, your state is maintained, and the phone can take now a bit more advantage of the form factor and show you more about what's going on around this place.
And this is actually not really a new thing in Android. We've had to deal with similar situations before where things like screen rotation or changing screen sizes or changing window size and multi-window.
So why should you care about continuity when you build your app?
Well, users unfold their devices for a reason. And usually, that's because they want to dive deeper into the task they're currently doing. So that really works best when they are not interrupted in their experience in doing so, and can continue where they left off before unfolding. So for a satisfying user experience, it's really important that this works well.
With the configuration change system folding and unfolding the device will be treated as a configuration change in the screen size and screen layout categories. And to support you with that, the Android system by default recreates your activities when a configuration change happens. This has the advantage of taking care of any layout changes you might want to make when taking advantage of the new configuration. But it also means that you are responsible for restoring the state the user was in after the activities we created. The onSaveInstanceState facility, and Jetpack library called ViewModel to support you with that. Alternatively, you could also decide to handle the configuration change yourself by just applying it and adjusting your layout. To do that, you can declare that you can handle the configuration change in your Android manifest. But that means that you'll have to manually adjust the layout, the new screen size, and new configuration. And for the best experience, make sure to correctly implement multi-window and declare your activity as sizable.
To deliver the best possible experience, both for foldable and for multi-display devices, we really encourage you to handle configuration changes whenever it's possible. And if your app really needs to know what display it is currently on, you can check in onCreate and onConfigurationChanged. With all new and existing platforms, you can choose to simply optimize your app, or build some unique multi-screen experience. You can decide whether you want to support multiple activity
instances, test your app, and set corresponding launch modes.
Don't forget that in this case, multiple activities may be focused and receive user input at the same time. Also, consider using the shared source of data with multiple view models in your app, and take advantage of other architecture components.
Finally, you can find more information blog posts. There's also a Samsung developer site where you will find more information about Samsung's devices and their guidelines. And for testing your apps, the Samsung emulator.
